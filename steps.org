#+title: Steps for leak_checker

* For precise leak checker (identify source of mallocs to display if there is leaks.)
1. Create script (with sed) to add preprocessor wrapper for malloc to mymalloc
2. Do compilation like before (with libmalloc.so / -lmalloc)

* Simplier leak checker (with same wrapper but modified)
1. Just do the code with the linked list (output will not be precise)
