* tester-libft
tester-libft is my personal tester for my 42's libft project. This is not the official tests but only the ones I think are important. The best is to use the maximum tests/testers you find to be sure your libft is perfect.

* Installation
The default structure is:
#+begin_example
.
|- libft/
|- tester-libft/
#+end_example
Change the location of your ~libft.a~ in the Makefile (variable LIBFT) if needed. Don't forget to also change the location of ~libft.h~ in ~lftest.h~

* Usage
Just run ~make~ and the Makefile will build your libft & launch the tests.

* Informations
The tester-libft uses [[https://cutest.sourceforge.net/][CuTest]] for unit testing every function of the libft. It is really simple to use and it takes only 2 files to work. If you want to create your own unit tests or modify mine, you can do so easily.
